Use https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints to expose localhost to internet (if you dont have ngrok, install it)
Dont forget to update ngrok route in https://app.mailgun.com/mg/receiving/routes each time you start ngrok
Use port 80 since it is the apache port = ask david if this is ok or should be changed to 8000 (artisan serve) or 5173 (vite)
